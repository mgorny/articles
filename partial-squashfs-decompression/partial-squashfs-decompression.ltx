\section{Introduction}

In a~previous article titled `using deltas to speed up SquashFS ebuild
repository updates', the~author has considered benefits of~using binary
deltas to update SquashFS images. The~proposed method has proven very
efficient in~terms of~disk I/O, memory and~CPU time use. However,
the~relatively large size of~deltas made network bandwidth
a~bottleneck.

The~rough estimations done at the~time proved that this is not a~major
issue for a~common client with a~moderate-bandwidth link such as~ADSL.
Nevertheless, the~size is an~inconvenience both to clients and~to mirror
providers. Assuming that there is an~upper bound on disk space consumed
by~snapshots, the~extra size reduces the~number of~snapshots stored
on~mirrors, and~therefore shortens the~supported update period.

The~most likely causes for the~excessive delta size include
the~complexity of~the~correlation between input and~compressed output.
Changes in~input files are likely to cause much larger changes
in~the~SquashFS output that the~tested delta algorithms fail to express
efficiently.

For~example, in~the~LZ family of~compression algorithms, a~change
in~input stream may affect the~contents of the~dictionary and~therefore
the~output stream following it. In~block-based compressors such
as~bzip2, a~change in~input may shift all the~following data moving it
across block boundaries. As a~result, the~contents and~compressed output
of~all blocks following it change.

Since SquashFS splits the~input into multiple blocks that are compressed
separately, the~scope of~this issue is much smaller. Nevertheless,
small changes occurring in~multiple blocks are able to grow delta twice
as~large as it would be if~the~data was not compressed. In this paper,
the~author explores the~possibility of~introducing a~transparent
decompression in the~delta generation process to~reduce the~delta size.


\section{Practical aspects of SquashFS recompression}

The~standard suite of~SquashFS tools do not provide a~direct way
of~recompressing or rebuilding the~filesystem directly. Obtaining
the~uncompressed version of the~archive can be achieved via unpacking
(or~mounting) the~original image and~packing it again, with all
compression options disabled. Recompressing it afterwards requires
another unpack-repack cycle.

This solution is both time- and~memory-consuming, and~therefore
very inefficient. In fact, applying the~delta to unpacked files rather
than the~intermediate image would save one cycle, and~likely result
in~smaller delta. Therefore, there is no point in~exploring use
of~SquashFS tools to repack the~image.

Developing a~dedicated tool to directly transform a~SquashFS image
to~another compression method is an~alternative. However, the~filesystem
format is very complex and~poorly documented. Therefore creating
a~tool that would be~able to create a~fully-compliant intermediate
filesystem would be hard and~time-consuming. The~process itself would
also be~unnecessarily complex since the~intermediate image would only
be~used for delta construction purposes.

Instead, the~author decided to write a~tool that would expand
the~compressed filesystem blocks without maintaining compliance with
the~filesystem format. The~intermediate image would only be~used
for~delta construction and~file reconstruction, and~the~resulting file
would be packed back into a~fully-compliant SquashFS.

This approach imposes two important requirements on the~process.
Firstly, the~delta needs to contain both changes to the~expanded
filesystem data and~to its structures. Secondly, the~recompression
process must produce compressed output of~the~same length (or~shorter,
if~padding is possible) as the~original image. Otherwise,
the~reconstructed image would simply be~invalid.

While this is already an~improvement over the~earlier considerations, it
could still be~improved. Most importantly, there is no real point
in~recompressing blocks that did not change between the~two images since
the~delta would be as~efficient on~the~compressed data. Therefore,
the~author decided to expand only the~blocks that are unique to~either
of~the~files.

This choice requires even more deterministic compression algorithm.
Since each data block may be used compressed and~uncompressed
in~different deltas, it is necessary for~the~compressed output to
be~byte-exact with the~reference snapshot. Otherwise, the~deltas may
produce randomly malformed output on~subsequent updates.
